    You don't say! Dignity and Respect have been evicted from this place, overshadowed 
    by Distrust and fueled by rampant slander. And Respect? She fled for her life in a 
    dark night, never to be seen or heard of again. Their house is now the property of the
    Richmonds and the Disparities.

    Oh!
    <break time="100ms" />
    Can you show me the house of the Laughter family?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Ah! You must be talking about Laughter, the sister of Happy. 
    <break time="100ms" />
    You guessed right. They are the ones I am speaking of!
    <break time="300ms" />
    You are so behind the times! They have sold their house to Mrs Lament many years ago and
    have left town.
    <break time="100ms" />
    Who is that you speak of? The Lovejoys? No sir. Since the death of Belief, they have never
    been heard of anymore. Their house is locked up and deserted.  
    <break time="300ms" />
    Well, is no one of the good old days here any more?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Speaking of the old residents, do you see the five story building on the right? 
    Yes, that is the house of Mr. Sadness. It was just a single story house before. Right beside
    that, Mrs Pain lives on the top floor of the third story building. 
    The foundation of that house is for ten stories, we hear! 
    <break time="100ms" />
    Do you see the house by the field. That belongs to the family of the Cheats. It was just a
    small hut in the olden days, but it is like a palace these days. Mistrust rents a floor in there.
    <break time="100ms" />
    And the house all the down there, by the little pond yonder, that is Mrs. Poverty's. That one,
    surprisingly, is just the same as it always was.  
    <break time="100ms" />
    And who may you be, sir?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Oh, my friends! 
    <break time="100ms" />
    My friends! Didn't you recognize me? I am Destiny. You may not have seen me before, but
    might have heard of me. 
    <break time="100ms" />
    And who might you two be?
    <break time="300ms" />
    I am Life and she is Peace. You know, we have been waiting for you for so long. Please stay with
    us in our community from now on. What is that you say? Where will you stay? Just tell us which house
    you would prefer and it would be yours. But don't leave, I need you.
    <break time="300ms" />
    I am sorry, my friend. Where there is no Faith, Love, Honesty, Dignity or Respect, how could 
    Life and Peace be present there?
    <break time="2s" />
    No, we will move along my friend. But rest assured, we shall neither call any place our home, 
    nor shall we stop until we find our worthy friends, who give meaning to life and let peace dwell.
    May be in another place, in another time, we will meet again in the 
    presence of our truest and most valued friends! But until then, Good Bye!
