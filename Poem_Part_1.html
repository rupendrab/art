    Just now, I received a lovely and striking narrative poem on Whatsapp. 
    By lovely, I mean that it struck a chord in my heart and I am very much moved.

    The poet is unnamed, the name of the poem is “Today's Society”. 
    Let me take the privilege of reading the poem so that you too may be touched by it.

    Here it goes! 
    <break time="300ms" />
    Hello, it seems like I have seen you somewhere before. 
    <break time="300ms" />
    Yes, we did use to live in this neighborhood.
    <break time="300ms" />
    I see, so are you looking for someone in particular today?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Right you are, sir, but you see, I am not seing any of the people I knew before. 
    So I was just looking around.
    <break time="100ms" />
    By the way, didn't Verity used to live in that house yonder?
    <break time="300ms" />
    You are right, but the Cunninghams have taken possession of it now. Would you like to meet them? 
    <break time="300ms" />
    No, not really! And how about that house over there?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Oh, you are speaking about the residence of the Constance family. So aptly named, ever conscientious. 
    They aren't there any more as well, the house is vacant now. The rumor is that the Greeds are going to buy it in an auction.    
    <break time="300ms" />
    Do you happen to know where they are now?
    <break time="300ms" />
    No, not really. How should I know?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Well, how about the Humanity and the Prudence households? Are they gone too? 
    <break time="300ms" />
    I had heard about them, I believe they used to live over there. Don't see them any more these days. 
    Nowadays, The Deceits and the Frauds live in their house. 
    <break time="300ms" />
    I understand. Do you happen to know the whereabots of Honesty? 
    <break time="300ms" />
    Which Honesty? The son of Prudence and the elder brother of Truth? It's a really sad story.
    He is suffering from cancer. I hear that he is suffering a lot. 
    He isn't going to live long, if you ask me.  
    <break time="300ms" />
    And Shame? Is their house abandoned as well?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Can houses remain vacant these days? But speaking of Shame and Humility, we don't see them any more. 
    There house is now lived in by the Nudity and the Agression folks.
    <break time="300ms" />
    And which house would that be?
    <break time="300ms" />
    Do you see that boy over there standing on the road? He is called Desire. And that is none other than the house of our Nudity.

    In my time the head of the community were Dignity and Respect. I had some urgent business with them.
